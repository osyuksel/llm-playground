Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever. 
But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue.

Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting?—Water—there is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned.

Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—don’t sleep of nights—do not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;—no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not. And as for going as cook,—though I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board—yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;—though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids. ","No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one’s sense of honor, particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it.

I had been cutting up some caper or other—I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,—my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed, though it was only two o’clock in the afternoon of the 21st June, the longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But there was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the third floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets. 
I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the small of my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse and worse—at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time. But she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes. At last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it—half steeped in dreams—I opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt a shock running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine. My arm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be broken. I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I often puzzle myself with it. 
Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg’s pagan arm thrown round me. But at length all the past night’s events soberly recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to the comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm—unlock his bridegroom clasp—yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to rouse him—“Queequeg!”—but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage’s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! “Queequeg!—in the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!” At length, by dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at last, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this particular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much civility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness; staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless, a man like Queequeg you don’t see every day, he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding. ","He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall one, by the by, and then—still minus his trowsers—he hunted up his boots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his next movement was to crush himself—boots in hand, and hat on—under the bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition stage—neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His education was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not been a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At last, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones—probably not made to order either—rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning.

He was a high chief, and a nobleman, and had been a great warrior in his own country. I was filled with admiration for him, and I felt a strange sort of kinship with him, as if we were both outcasts from our respective worlds. I was curious to know more about him, and I asked him where he came from. He pointed to a map on the wall, and I saw that he was from the South Sea Islands.

58,"But as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless, indefinite as God—so, better is it to perish in that howling infinite, than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety! For worm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of the terrible! is all this agony so vain? Take heart, take heart, O Bulkington! Bear thee grimly, demigod!

CHAPTER 24. The Advocate. ","As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling; and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit; therefore, I am all anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales. ","The Advocate was a little, snub-nosed man; so cunning and so crisp withal, that you would have thought him a piece of saturnine mechanism wound up to go for ever; a man of business,—not of sentiment; a man with a face like a shrewd little debtor's ledger, and eyes that looked as if they had been used to reckon the weighings of every port of call. Whenever any knot of whaling-men were to be argued for or against, in the town or at the Custom-house, the Advocate was the man; brief, to the point, with a dry, cutting eloquence that had the same effect upon obstinate ignorance as a gimlet upon knotty plank. He could clench an argument as a shipwright clinches a rib—so firm, so tight, that nothing more could be done to it. People who loved fine words were displeased with him; but the plain, practical mariners loved and trusted him as a man who could get them off a scrape, or save them an expense; and, which is more, he loved them in his way, being a man to whom stern, honest use and real service were as good as homilies and long prayers.",gpt-5-mini,44,False

","Before the high and beating of the sun upon the deck the Advocate—so men called him, not because he argued any cause with the magistrate's gown, but because, in ship-world terms, he argued for prudence and order—stood at the bow rail and began to speak, not to preach to the crew, but to lay down a price for their safety, their souls, and their voyage; he spoke with a tone that was grave, and the men listened, some with impatience, some with a smile of understanding, for the captain's orders hung over them like a cloud, and there was in that talk a kind of solemn arithmetic by which they must measure their chances against the coastwise sea.",gpt-5-nano,44,False
60,"That great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was given to the enlightened world by the whaleman. After its first blunder-born discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships long shunned those shores as pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched there. The whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony. Moreover, in the infancy of the first Australian settlement, the emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters. The uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth, and do commercial homage to the whale-ship, that cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations. If that double-bolted land, Japan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the whale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due; for already she is on the threshold.

","But perhaps the whale is not the only creature that has been overlooked in the annals of literature; for the very act of whaling itself, with its grand and terrible beauty, has inspired countless tales and legends, even if they remain unrecorded in the grand tomes of history. The whaleman, with his harpoon and his heart full of adventure, embodies a spirit of exploration and conquest that resonates through the ages, a testament to humanity's relentless pursuit of the unknown. In the depths of the ocean, where the leviathan swims, lies a world that has yet to be fully understood, a realm that calls to the brave and the curious alike. Thus, while the whale may lack a singular voice to sing its praises, the stories of those who chase it are woven into the very fabric of our collective narrative, echoing the triumphs and tragedies of mankind's eternal struggle against nature's vast and unfathomable depths.",gpt-4o-mini,44,False

CHAPTER 33. The Specksnyder. 
Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet. ","The large importance attached to the harpooneer’s vocation is evinced by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an officer called the Specksnyder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In those days, the captain’s authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain’s more inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling ground) the command of the ship’s deck is also his; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as their social equal. ","For, in the fishery, the harpooneers are not only the chief agents in the capture of the whales, but they are also the most important members of the crew, and their peculiarities and customs often influence the entire ship's atmosphere. Each harpooneer has his own distinct personality and style, which can create a unique dynamic on board, sometimes leading to rivalries or friendships that shape the daily life of the crew. The relationship between the captain and the harpooneer is particularly significant, as it can determine the success of the voyage and the morale of the men.",gpt-4o-mini,47,False

","The harpooneers, in fact, are a distinct order of men; you may as well attempt to confound the astrologer with the surgeon, as the harpooneer with any other ship-officer. They have peculiar privileges and peculiar duties; and upon many points, peculiar privileges mean peculiar responsibilities. They form, in point of fact, a separate little community on board; and as among nations, so among ships, where diverse tongues and temperaments meet, this separate community is a safeguard both for discipline and for that license which springs from too near familiarity. Their mess is their home; and though they dine often at the captain's table when favours are to be won, yet, as a general rule, they abide by themselves, sitting cross-legged upon the hatchway, or ranged along the fore-hold, with their knives and clubs about them, discussing fishes and fights, and hearing, in brief, their own laws read out and enforced.",gpt-5-mini,44,False

","These harpooneers are a different order from the ordinary seamen; they have their peculiarities, their own codes, their rough, noisome camaraderie, and a certain independence that sometimes jars with the officers who command them, yet which in the main binds them to the common peril and common profit of their craft. The specksnyder, who presides over their work aboard the ship and in the boats, keeps his hard eye on the least movement of the line, the smallest bend of the pole, and the instant of the whale's turning; for in these matters, as in others, the keenest moment is everything, and the slow wake of a glimmering hope in the offing may depend on a single stitch, a single motion, a moment’s calm before the plunge.",gpt-5-nano,47,False

","Aye, aye! what a wisdom is in the sea! And what a wisdom is in the man! For as the sea is ever changing, so is the man; and yet, in the midst of all this change, there is a certain constancy, a certain depth of thought that remains. Ahab, with his fierce and unyielding spirit, was a reflection of the very ocean he sought to conquer. The waves that crashed against the ship were but echoes of the tumult within him, and as he paced the deck, he was not merely walking; he was wrestling with the very essence of existence itself. The crew, watching him, could sense the storm brewing not just in the skies above, but in the heart of their captain, and they knew that whatever lay ahead would be as unpredictable as the sea itself.",gpt-4o-mini,46,False

Let him peck; the more he pecks the more he'll know there is a shell.” And as they spoke, Ahab, still pacing, now and then shot a sudden glance at them; and those who stood nearest could see, in the quick contraction of the muscles round his clipped lips, that some fierce idea, like a bird of prey, had just wheeled and lighted on its talons in his breast. Often, too, when he paused, he would lay his hand upon the wheel or the binnacle, as if to assure himself of the ship's being there to bear him on; and at such times his whole figure, contracted, enormous, and impossible, looked for an instant like a thing watching for an opportunity to spring.

Let's see what breed of thing this one is before we guess how he'll fly his nest.” He turned his head a fraction and looked once more toward Ahab, whose figure, solitary and straight as a mast, moved with that unhurried, inexorable rhythm that seemed to tread under him the very deck itself. “Let him be,” Flask added, more to the deck than to Stubb, “a man like that will find his shore when his own wind blows him there.”",gpt-5-nano,42,False

On the contrary, it seemed, that mainly at Steelkilt’s instigation, they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the ship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing—namely, not to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For, spite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still maintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale. 
“But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till all was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney the chief mate’s watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he insisted, against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the head of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other circumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge. 
“During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship’s side. In this attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between this was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o’clock, in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his leisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his watches below. ",“‘What are you making there?’ said a shipmate. ,"Quite in the same breath of his cunning, Steelkilt laid hold of a long, slender cord that he had braided, and, slipping out noiselessly from below, coiled it about the foremast like a serpent awaiting its hour. The hour of two—so long foretold—took possession of the ship; Radney, with his head sinking low upon his chest, leaned again and again on the gunwale, and the watch below, wearied with the monotony of their long vigil, slept on; then, when the mutineer’s moment came, the Lakeman sprang—yet not with a cry or a word, but with a sudden jerk of the rope that sent the sleeping guard to his feet and cinched his hands behind him.",gpt-5-nano,46,False
120,"“‘A pretty scholar,’ laughed the Lakeman. ‘Adios, Senor!’ and leaping into the sea, he swam back to his comrades. 
“Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the roots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due time arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination. There, luck befriended him; two ships were about to sail for France, and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed. They embarked; and so for ever got the start of their former captain, had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution. 
“Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived, and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized Tahitians, who had been somewhat used to the sea. Chartering a small native schooner, he returned with them to his vessel; and finding all right there, again resumed his cruisings.

As the days passed, the ship sailed on through the tranquil waters, the sun shining brightly upon the deck, and the crew, though inexperienced, began to find their rhythm.

He cursed and tore his hair; he swore he would follow them to the ends of the earth; he would hang them all when once he had them in his hands; he would make an example of Steelkilt for evermore to terrorize other mutineers. But a man may howl out his vengeance as a wolf does his hunger, and yet the prey be far beyond his reach. The two French ships had already carried the runaways safe across the sea; and the Tahitians, though they would gladly have turned informers, were as silent and as faithless as the trade-winds. So the captain, finding that all pursuit would but waste time and incense; and having to mind his voyage, and to chase the cold, transient lucre of whales, gave up the matter in a manner becoming a practical man: he shrugged his shoulders, put his hand to his helm, and once more steered his craft into the vast indifferent Pacific.",gpt-5-mini,44,False

Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of interregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could have so gross an injustice. And yet still further pondering—while I jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten to jam him—still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in most cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. True, you may say that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg’s monkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I came very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I would, I only had the management of one end of it.* ","*The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb, in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey-rope holder. ","And as for Queequeg, why, he was a man of a peculiar character; he was a noble savage, and I could not help but admire his strength and skill as he maneuvered about the whale. The sight of him, with his tattooed arms and fierce determination, made me feel a strange kinship with him, as if we were both engaged in a sacred rite. The whale, with its massive body, lay before us like a great mountain, and I felt the weight of our task pressing down upon me. Each time I pulled on the monkey-rope, I was reminded of the bond we shared, a bond forged in the heat of the moment and the peril of the sea. It was a reminder that life itself is a precarious balance, a dance between danger and survival, and that we are all connected in ways we may not fully understand.",gpt-4o-mini,43,False
138,"Being the savage’s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar in his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead whale’s back. You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by a long cord. Just so, from the ship’s steep side, did I hold Queequeg down there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist. 
It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both ends; fast to Queequeg’s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow leather one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time, were wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both usage and honor demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should drag me down in his wake.

","And yet you must not imagine from all this that I took a gloomy view of my Siamese partnership. Far from it. For, in the first place, it gave me a sort of social warmth; and in the next, I was delighted to find, in Queequeg’s companionship, such a strange compound of the wild and the genial, of the fierce and the faithful. Never elsewhere did I meet with such savage trustfulness; and while I had to be always on the alert against those sudden spasms of passion which might jerk both of us to destruction, I had likewise the constant comfort of his steady, cheerful dependence upon me. Thus, between the peril and the pleasure of our union, I learned a curious philosophy of human fellowship—how much of our lives is a balance of mutual risk and mutual solace; and how, under Providence and hempen cord, we all advance together, sometimes to glory, sometimes to ruin, but evermore held fast to one another by ties we little weigh till they are tried.",gpt-5-mini,44,False

It’s the first foul wind I ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so before? it must be, he’s lost his tiller.” ","The old fellow, therefore, went on, drifting and bubbling like some monstrous, rotten log, while the other whales, conscious perhaps of his infirmity, paid him no heed, and kept their steady, well-arranged line; but presently, either from some hidden impulse, or by reason of the stress they laid upon the water, that pallid hump of a whale, which had been so long laboring in the wake, began to heave and roll more heavily than usual, and suddenly, with a heavy splintering sound, gave his tail a twist round, as if to right himself, and sent up a thick, yellowish spray; then, wheeling short, he made for the flank of the nearest of the eight, and as if defying his better speed and youth, darted in among them like an old ram among a flock of sheep, bawling and blowing, till the whole party were thrown into confusion, their order broken, and their great wake shivered into a thousand offshoots; whereupon all the boats, those that had been first at the spot as well as those that now came crowding up, were at once in the thick of the melee, each man straining at his oar, each harpooner glaring and eager, and the ocean round about seeming to boil and smoke as if the air itself had been set on fire by the fury and the uproar.",gpt-5-mini,43,False
151,"His necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his ship’s side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the mast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick, that without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders. 
Now, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German boats that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the Pequod’s keels. There were eight whales, an average pod. Aware of their danger, they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind, rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness. They left a great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea. 
Full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge, humped old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed afflicted with the jaundice, or some other infirmity. Whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance, seemed questionable; for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social. Nevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their back water must have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet. His spout was short, slow, and laborious; coming forth with a choking sort of gush, and spending itself in torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity, causing the waters behind him to upbubble. ","“Who’s got some paregoric?” said Stubb, “he has the stomach-ache, I’m afraid. Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache! Adverse winds are holding mad Christmas in him, boys. It’s the first foul wind I ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so before? it must be, he’s lost his tiller.” ","All this while the great ship, Derick’s boat, and the German craft kept on their regular course, bending more and more to windward, while the massive old bull, as if weary of the chase, drowsed his way through the foam, his yellowish carapace glistening with the spray. The wake swelled and split, and the water behind him looked like a second sea searching for him; and presently, suddenly, he rose a little in the trough, a dull, heavy lurch of his body showing that he felt the sting of the boats at his flanks. Then, with a kind of stubborn, donkey-like grunt, he sank again, and the line, taut with the effort, drew tight across the sea, and the German boats, quick as swallows, sprang forward once more, while the Pequod, with its peculiar quiet, moved on after them.",gpt-5-nano,42,False
152,"Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the surface. If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him. But it is not so. For young whales, in the highest health, and swelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of life, with all their panting lard about them; even these brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink. 
Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this accident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty Right Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale; his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there are instances where, after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale again rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this is obvious. Gases are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings, among the Bays of New Zealand, when a Right Whale gives token of sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty of rope; so that when the body has gone down, they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again. 
It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the Pequod’s mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a Fin-Back, belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of its incredible power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back’s spout is so similar to the Sperm Whale’s, that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it. And consequently Derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all sail, made after her four young keels, and thus they all disappeared far to leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.

But though in the course of his continual voyages the whaleman is often led to realize more or less vividly the perils of the chase, yet let me say here, that the dangers of the whale fishery are not half so much to be dreaded as the dangers of the land; because while for the most part the former are merely physical, the latter are, or rather proceed from, those moral horrors which sometimes at least attend the former. The maxim holds true, that, though the man of the land may die, yet the man of the sea may live; and while the former is often found to be a coward, the latter is often found to be a hero.",gpt-4o,100,True

Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of Jonah and the whale. But then there were some sceptical Greeks and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times, equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale, and Arion and the dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts, for all that. 
One old Sag-Harbor whaleman’s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew story was this:—He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles, embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented Jonah’s whale with two spouts in his head—a peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the varieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen have this saying, “A penny roll would choke him”; his swallow is so very small. But, to this, Bishop Jebb’s anticipative answer is ready. It is not necessary, hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the whale’s belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the Right Whale’s mouth would accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right Whale is toothless. ","Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale’s gastric juices. But this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a _dead_ whale—even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has been divined by other continental commentators, that when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his escape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a figure-head; and, I would add, possibly called “The Whale,” as some craft are nowadays christened the “Shark,” the “Gull,” the “Eagle.” Nor have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver—an inflated bag of wind—which the endangered prophet swam to, and so was saved from a watery doom. Poor Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round. But he had still another reason for his want of faith. It was this, if I remember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days’ journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much more than three days’ journey across from the nearest point of the Mediterranean coast.

","Be it observed, however, that all this is nothing but a circumstantial statement of what is palpably a case of a curious exception; in fact, a story which, in the face of all the facts, bears every mark of being a palpable exaggeration. For, in the first place, the Right Whale is not the whale that is traditionally associated with Jonah, but rather the Sperm Whale, in whose mouth he could not have been lodged, as the Sperm Whale's mouth is far too small to admit of such a thing. Furthermore, the Sperm Whale is not known to frequent the waters of the Mediterranean, where the story of Jonah is said to have taken place.

Moreover, the very fact that such stories have persisted through the ages, despite the skepticism of some, speaks to a deeper truth that resonates with the human experience.

160,"Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope, and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less celestial, I celebrate a tail. 
Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale’s tail to begin at that point of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet. The compact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness. At the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap, then sideways recede from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy between. In no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost expansion in the full grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across. 
The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut into it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:—upper, middle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are long and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running crosswise between the outside layers. This triune structure, as much as anything else, imparts power to the tail. To the student of old Roman walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of the masonry. ","But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough, the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point.

Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale’s tail to begin at that point of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet. The compact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness. At the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap, then sideways recede from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy between. In no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost expansion in the full grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across. 
The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut into it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:—upper, middle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are long and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running crosswise between the outside layers. This triune structure, as much as anything else, imparts power to the tail.

","In the tail of the Sperm Whale, we see a remarkable adaptation to its environment, a powerful tool for propulsion in the vast ocean depths. The immense strength and flexibility of this appendage allow the whale to navigate through the water with grace and speed, propelling its massive body with astonishing agility. It is not merely a rudder or a means of steering; it is a vital instrument of survival, enabling the whale to breach the surface, dive to great depths, and evade predators. The tail's design is a testament to the evolutionary prowess of nature, showcasing how form and function can harmoniously coexist. As we delve deeper into the anatomy of this magnificent creature, we uncover the intricate relationships between its physical attributes and the challenges of its aquatic existence.",gpt-4o-mini,45,False

","In action, moreover, the tail is the whale’s great motive power; it is the heavy pendulum by which he propels himself through the ocean, the broad oar that alone impels that ponderous cylinder of life. Up and down, with strokes measured more by the vast compass of the vertebral column than by any muscular contraction of the ribs—up and down, the tail pits the waters into foam, while the whole bulk of the monster slides forward as if driven by some subterranean engine. When it is suddenly reversed, too, behold that fearful phenomenon called the fluked-back, where the whale, paradoxically, seems to drive himself backward with a violence that sets the water in shivered ridges; and then again, by a single mighty sweep, he will bury his head and forequarters in an abyss of spray, leaving the stern like a giant vane above. It is by means of this organ that the whale executes all his graceful evolutions, and it is upon this that, in contest, the harpooneer must so often depend; for a blow upon the base of the tail will cause the whole body to writhe as a wounded serpent, and may, if rightly administered, bring even the proud Leviathan to a helpless pause.",gpt-5-mini,48,False

In about three minutes’ time, Queequeg’s harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray in our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered straight for the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise unprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated; yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb.

But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off from this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging away from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no time to make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with.

It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used. For then, more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. But sperm whales are not every day encountered; while you may, then, you must kill all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you must wing them, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure. Hence it is, that at times like these the drugg, comes into requisition.

All that most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable in Moby Dick.

“Oh! keep cool—cool? yes, that’s the word! why don’t you pack those whales in ice while you’re working at ’em? But joking aside, though; do you know, Rose-bud, that it’s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn’t a gill in his whole carcase.” 
“I know that well enough; but, d’ye see, the Captain here won’t believe it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before. But come aboard, and mayhap he’ll believe you, if he won’t me; and so I’ll get out of this dirty scrape.” ","“Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,” rejoined Stubb, and with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene presented itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they worked rather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good humor. All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many jib-booms. Now and then pairs of them would drop their work, and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their nostrils. Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it constantly filled their olfactories. ","“Come, then,” cried the Guernseyman, tossing his head impatiently, “we’ll go aboard and see what the captain has to say about it, though I tell ye he’ll not believe a word till he’s seen it with his own eyes.” And, drawing the other man after him, he strode away toward the little gangway, the Rose-bud glancing after them with a look of half-doubt and half curiosity, for though the matter was ridiculous enough, there was something in the air that made one eager to hear more.",gpt-5-nano,45,False

I boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the forecastle. It was a fine gam we had, and they were all trumps—every soul on board. A short life to them, and a jolly death. And that fine gam I had—long, very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his ivory heel—it minds me of the noble, solid, Saxon hospitality of that ship; and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember me, if I ever lose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had flip? Yes, and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came (for it’s squally off there by Patagonia), and all hands—visitors and all—were called to reef topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each other aloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the howling gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. However, the masts did not go overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that we had to pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to my taste. 
The beef was fine—tough, but with body in it. They said it was bull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for certain, how that was. They had dumplings too; small, but substantial, symmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings. I fancied that you could feel them, and roll them about in you after they were swallowed. If you stooped over too far forward, you risked their pitching out of you like billiard-balls. The bread—but that couldn’t be helped; besides, it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the bread contained the only fresh fare they had. But the forecastle was not very light, and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it. But all in all, taking her from truck to helm, considering the dimensions of the cook’s boilers, including his own live parchment boilers; fore and aft, I say, the Samuel Enderby was a jolly ship; of good fare and plenty; fine flip and strong; crack fellows all, and capital from boot heels to hat-band. 
But why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other English whalers I know of—not all though—were such famous, hospitable ships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the can, and the joke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking, and laughing? I will tell you. The abounding good cheer of these English whalers is matter for historical research. Nor have I been at all sparing of historical whale research, when it has seemed needed. ","The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders, Zealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant in the fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions, touching plenty to eat and drink. For, as a general thing, the English merchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so the English whaler. Hence, in the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural, but incidental and particular; and, therefore, must have some special origin, which is here pointed out, and will be still further elucidated. ","When I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one’s sense of honor, particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you.

In the midst of the vast, rolling waves, they find a camaraderie that transcends the ordinary bounds of society. It is a bond forged in the crucible of hardship and danger, where laughter and song echo against the backdrop of the stormy sea. This spirit of fellowship is what makes the English whalers so unique; they share not only their food and drink but also their stories, their dreams, and their fears.

","But here, in treating of the sperm whale's scientific, anatomical, and historical aspects, I must needs insert a little parenthetical remark, which I fear may possibly seem irrelevant to some. But I cannot forbear. In the length he attains, and in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale; but is of a less portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin is some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end. Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface. When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back. The Fin-back is not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters. Very shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man. This leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back. From having the baleen in his mouth, the Fin-back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic species denominated Whalebone whales, that is, whales with baleen. Of these so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are little known. Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed whales and rostrated whales. But as yet, we have to do with only one of them, the Fin-back.",gpt-4o,44,False

","No naturalist, I think, will say he has; or, at least, none that have had the opportunity of comparing old time figures with modern.  Those gigantic proportions which the whale bears, are not a thing of accident or casual growth; he is not a kind of accidental giant that, by the mere luxuries of climate or food, swells out into bulk; but he is of a specified form and scale; and, so far as the testimony of whalemen goes, he has kept it.  The Greenland patriarch of the right whale, the seawise head and shoulders of the spermaceti tribe, the vast hulks of the rorqual and the porpoise-like fishes of that family, have come down, in their several lines, with very little change from the days of the earliest navigators.  Nay, if anything, the seas still seem to breed their monsters as large as ever; and the very terror which they inspired in the ancients, and which has visibly increased the imagination since then, bears on its face the stamp of enduring truth; for the whale’s greatness is a reality beyond the exaggerations of seamen or the poetic amplifications of the historians.",gpt-5-mini,46,False

If, from generation to generation, he has preserved his greatness, shall we pretend to reckon him according to any man-made rule?

Whereas, we have already seen, that the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale. And I have heard, on whalemen’s authority, that Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture. 
But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods; may it not be, that since Adam’s time they have degenerated? 
Assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. For Pliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and Aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length—Rope Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales! And even in the days of Banks and Solander, Cooke’s naturalists, we find a Danish member of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales (reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards; that is, three hundred and sixty feet. And Lacépède, the French naturalist, in his elaborate history of whales, in the very beginning of his work (page 3), sets down the Right Whale at one hundred metres, three hundred and twenty-eight feet.

But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods; may it not be, that since Adam’s time they have degenerated? 
Assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. For Pliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and Aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length—Rope Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales! And even in the days of Banks and Solander, Cooke’s naturalists, we find a Danish member of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales (reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards; that is, three hundred and sixty feet.

","But, as for the Sperm Whale, it is a creature of a different order; and while it may not reach the colossal dimensions attributed to the ancient leviathans, it is still a formidable being in its own right. The Sperm Whale, with its massive head and powerful body, is a marvel of nature, and its very existence challenges the limits of our understanding of marine life. Its deep dives and remarkable hunting skills set it apart from other whales, and its unique physiology allows it to thrive in the depths of the ocean where few creatures dare to venture. Thus, while we may ponder the size and grandeur of the whales of yore, we must also appreciate the extraordinary adaptations and capabilities of the modern Sperm Whale, which continues to inspire awe and fascination in those who seek to understand the mysteries of the sea.",gpt-4o-mini,45,False

It is true, too, that distance and perspective will add enormously to a whale’s apparent size; and that numbers in old days, as now, were multiplied by hearsay, till a spotted whale that measured twenty feet ashore became in the second telling a whale of two hundred.",gpt-5-mini,45,False

Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people on deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every one’s consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some dying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since they will shortly trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows ought to be indulged.

He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock drawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his boat. All by his own request, also, biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of fresh water was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for a pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that he might make trial of its comforts, if any it had. He lay without moving a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god, Yojo. Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch he called it) to be placed over him.

But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles, where the beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye do one little errand for me? Seek out one Pip, who's now been missing long: I think he's in those far Antilles. If ye find him, then comfort him; for he must be very sad; for look! he's left his tambourine behind;—I found it.

They had come to regard him as a sort of oracle, and his whims were indulged with a good-natured tolerance. The captain, too, had taken a liking to him, and often stopped to chat with him, even as he lay there, his face serene and calm. The coffin had become a fixture on the ship, and the men joked about it, saying it was a good luck charm, a sign that they would have a prosperous voyage.

Presently, hearing their subdued laughter, he raised himself a little, and, stretching one arm from under the blanket, pointed to his forehead with his forefinger, as much as to say, “Do you think I am going to die to-day?”—then, with his odd half-smile, lay down and presently fell asleep.

208,"“I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so? Nor was it wrung from me; nor do I now drop these links. Thou canst blind; but I can then grope. Thou canst consume; but I can then be ashes. Take the homage of these poor eyes, and shutter-hands. I would not take it. The lightning flashes through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and ache; my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some stunning ground. Oh, oh! Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to thee. Light though thou be, thou leapest out of darkness; but I am darkness leaping out of light, leaping out of thee! The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not? There burn the flames! Oh, thou magnanimous! now I do glory in my genealogy. But thou art but my fiery father; my sweet mother, I know not. Oh, cruel! what hast thou done with her? There lies my puzzle; but thine is greater. Thou knowest not how came ye, hence callest thyself unbegotten; certainly knowest not thy beginning, hence callest thyself unbegun. I know that of me, which thou knowest not of thyself, oh, thou omnipotent. There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou clear spirit, to whom all thy eternity is but time, all thy creativeness mechanical. Through thee, thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly see it. Oh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast thy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief. Here again with haughty agony, I read my sire. Leap! leap up, and lick the sky! I leap with thee; I burn with thee; would fain be welded with thee; defyingly I worship thee!” 
“The boat! the boat!” cried Starbuck, “look at thy boat, old man!” 
Ahab’s harpoon, the one forged at Perth’s fire, remained firmly lashed in its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his whale-boat’s bow; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off; and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale, forked fire. As the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent’s tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm—“God, God is against thee, old man; forbear! ’tis an ill voyage! ill begun, ill continued; let me square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a fair wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage than this.” ","Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the braces—though not a sail was left aloft. For the moment all the aghast mate’s thoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. But dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and snatching the burning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch among them; swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope’s end. Petrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from the fiery dart that he held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab again spoke:— ","“Aye, aye! what does thou see?” cried Ahab, “what does thou see? I see a white whale! I see a white whale!” And with that, he turned his back on Starbuck, and the crew, and the ship, and the sea, and the sky, and the world, and all that was in it, and he plunged into the depths of his own soul, where the shadows of his past loomed large and dark. The crew, bewildered, looked at one another, unsure of what to do, as Ahab’s voice echoed in their ears, a haunting melody of obsession and despair. “To the chase! To the chase!” he shouted, his eyes wild with fervor, “for the white whale is out there, and I will not rest until I have him!” The ship trembled beneath the weight of his words, and the wind howled in response, as if the very elements conspired to aid him in his relentless pursuit.",gpt-4o-mini,45,False

Thou canst consume; but I can then be ashes. Take the homage of these poor eyes, and shutter-hands. I would not take it. The lightning flashes through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and ache; my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some stunning ground. Oh, oh! Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to thee. Light though thou be, thou leapest out of darkness; but I am darkness leaping out of light, leaping out of thee! The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not? There burn the flames! Oh, thou magnanimous! now I do glory in my genealogy. But thou art but my fiery father; my sweet mother, I know not. Oh, cruel! what hast thou done with her? There lies my puzzle; but thine is greater. Thou knowest not how came ye, hence callest thyself unbegotten; certainly knowest not thy beginning, hence callest thyself unbegun. I know that of me, which thou knowest not of thyself, oh, thou omnipotent. There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou clear spirit, to whom all thy eternity is but time, all thy creativeness mechanical. Through thee, thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly see it. Oh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast thy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief. Here again with haughty agony, I read my sire. Leap! leap up, and lick the sky! I leap with thee; I burn with thee; would fain be welded with thee; defyingly I worship thee!” 
“The boat! the boat!” cried Starbuck, “look at thy boat, old man!” 
Ahab’s harpoon, the one forged at Perth’s fire, remained firmly lashed in its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his whale-boat’s bow; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off; and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale, forked fire. As the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent’s tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm—“God, God is against thee, old man; forbear! ’tis an ill voyage! ill begun, ill continued; let me square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a fair wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage than this.” ","Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the braces—though not a sail was left aloft. For the moment all the aghast mate’s thoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. But dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and snatching the burning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch among them; swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope’s end. Petrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from the fiery dart that he held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab again spoke:— ","“Ay, ay, Starbuck!” cried Ahab, wrenching himself loose from the grasp that would have stayed him; “thy words are wise, and save not me. God keep thee, man of peace; but I am chained to a thing that’s not of heaven. Hear me—what I have built into my brain, what iron and fire have taught me, that I will go on with. Begone with thy prayer; that prayer is for those who bow—’tis not for me. Strike home thy sail, trim thy yards, put off for harbour if thou wilt; I thank thee, but I am bound. I have no ship now but one thought; and that floats ever with me, drives me, and will not be struck from out my heart. Do what thou wilt—doubtless thou wilt be saved; I—I shall have my voyage.”",gpt-5-mini,46,False

Why this strife of the chase? why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance? how the richer or better is Ahab now? Behold. Oh, Starbuck! is it not hard, that with this weary load I bear, one poor leg should have been snatched from under me? Here, brush this old hair aside; it blinds me, that I seem to weep. Locks so grey did never grow but from out some ashes! But do I look very old, so very, very old, Starbuck? I feel deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as though I were Adam, staggering beneath the piled centuries since Paradise. God! God! God!—crack my heart!—stave my brain!—mockery! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of grey hairs, have I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus intolerably old? Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into a human eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to gaze upon God. By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is the magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye. No, no; stay on board, on board!—lower not when I do; when branded Ahab gives chase to Moby Dick. That hazard shall not be thine. No, no! not with the far away home I see in that eye!” ","“Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all! why should any one give chase to that hated fish! Away with me! let us fly these deadly waters! let us home! Wife and child, too, are Starbuck’s—wife and child of his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow youth; even as thine, sir, are the wife and child of thy loving, longing, paternal old age! Away! let us away!—this instant let me alter the course! How cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would we bowl on our way to see old Nantucket again! I think, sir, they have some such mild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket.” ","Starbuck, with a pale, steady face, answered, “Captain, I am with you to the death—if I could but keep you from yourself.” Ahab’s lips curled, not in laughter, but in a grim smile. “Then go thy way, Starbuck,” he said, “and mind only thy oars and thy duty; for the moment you stand between me and Moby Dick you stand for a kind of death that belongs to the sea.”",gpt-5-nano,43,False
